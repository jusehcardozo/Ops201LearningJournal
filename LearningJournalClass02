Today's learning experience was towards GitHub and Visual Studio Code, today I finally learned a bit on how to mess with GitHub and learned some more on how to work with Visual Studio Code. 
We got together as a group on Remo and helped each other on how to troubleshoot our problems and I believe everyone finished the day with a victory.
I feel that this will be the only way some of us will make to the end of this course, by helping each other.
